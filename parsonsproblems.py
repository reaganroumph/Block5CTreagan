Use this document to record your answers to the Parson's Problems
shared in class.

Remember: the idea behind a Parson's Problem is that you are
shown completely correct code that is presented OUT OF ORDER.
When arranged correctly, the code does what the Parson's Problem
says it should do.

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #1 below:
for x in range (0,10):
    print ("hello world")

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #2 below:
myList = []
myList.append("apples")
myList.append("pineapples")
print (myList)

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #3 below:
x = int(x)
x = input("type a number")
if x > 0:
    print("That're more than nothing!")
else:
    print("That's a small number!")
